# readme_banner

linklord was created out of the frustration of finding myself constantly digging up urls when writing markdown articles. I wrote **linklord** to automate that process. A side effect was that it also is a quite nice way to manage, and organize bookmarks in general.  

See the [wiki][linklord wiki] for more info and examples of use cases.  

# examples

`linklord --help` display help  
`linklord --version` display version  
`man linklord` show man page    

# readme_install

If you are using **Arch linux**, you can install the linklord package from [AUR][linklord AUR].  

Or follow the instructions below to install from source:  

(*configure the installation destination in the Makefile if needed*)

``` text
$ git clone https://github.com/budlabs/linklord.git
$ cd linklord
# make install
$ linklord --version

linklord - version: 2020.01
updated: 2020-01-03 by budRich
```

The only file you really need is `linklord.bash` , you can also just add that to your **$PATH**.
